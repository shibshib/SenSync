### SerialPortSample ###

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Command line tool that reads accelerometer data from Serial port. The reason for
the Mac version of the SerialCommunicator is for collecting data for the machine-
machine aspect of this project. The nodes cannot be remote and must be connected
to a laptop for the walking data collection. Since I have a Macbook pro, 
I needed a solution that mirrored the Windows version of the SerialCommunicator in this project 
so I can collect the data to my laptop.
